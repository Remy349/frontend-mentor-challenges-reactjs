# frontend-mentor-challenges-reactjs
This is the challenge section of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) site, 
it is purely static with the only purpose of recreating its structure.

It was developed with ReactJS using [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) for the generation of the files and structure of the project. 
I made use of functional components, props and SCSS for styling.
